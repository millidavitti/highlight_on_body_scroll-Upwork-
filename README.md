# Sticky navigation with highlight on body scroll

## User Story

I would like to recreate the sticky navigation found on the Porsche website (view on mobile for best effect):

https://www.porsche.com/uk/models/718/718-models/718-cayman-gts-4/

You'll notice that when you scroll, the sticky navigation also scrolls so that the correct button is always in view.

I have tried recreating this on Codepen but have been unable to make the navigation scroll to the correct button when viewed on mobile.

I am looking for a developer that can help with this task.
